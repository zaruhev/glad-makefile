# GLAD Makefile script
A Makefile compilation/installation script for version 2.0 of [Dav1dde's GLAD library](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad).

## Contributing
This installation script is still in its "it works on my system" phase, so any and all contributions are welcome.

TODOs are written sporadically in Makefile.
